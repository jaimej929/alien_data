## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

That's why we are hiring you. We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset. We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.

You can handle this... right? The planet Earth needs to know what we have found!


## General Info
The purpose this project is to filter data by creating a javascript app that takes information from the input of the person trying to find a specific thing, then publishing all the data that comes with the specific request.

## Setup
There are two folders UFO 1 only filters them out with the date, while UFO 2 filters by multiple catergories.
